    "CNNs are inspired by the structure of the human brain. The brain has a visual cortex that is responsible for processing visual information. The visual cortex has a small region of cells that are sensitive to specific regions of the visual field. This region is called the receptive field. The receptive fields of different cells overlap to cover the entire visual field. The cells in the visual cortex are sensitive to different features of the visual field like edges, colors, etc.\n",

    "CNN受到人脑结构的启发。人脑有一个负责处理视觉信息的视觉皮层。视觉皮层有一个对视觉场的特定区域敏感的小区域。这个区域被称为感受野。不同细胞的感受野重叠，覆盖整个视觉场。视觉皮层的细胞对视觉场的不同特征敏感，如边缘、颜色等。"
